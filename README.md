## Introduction

Phoenix/Mix template for projects at [Nimble](https://nimblehq.co/).

## Prerequisites

NimbleTemplate has been developed and actively tested with the below environment:

- Mix 1.13.3
- Elixir 1.13.3
- Erlang/OTP 24.2.2
- Phoenix 1.6.11
- Node 16.15.0

## Installation

*Note:* NimbleTemplate only works on a _new_ Phoenix/Mix project, applying it to an existing Phoenix/Mix project might not work as expected.

Step 1: Generate a new project

```bash
# New Phoenix project
mix phx.new awesome_project

# New Mix project
mix new awesome_project
```

Step 2: Add `nimble_template` dependency to `mix.exs`:

```elixir
def deps do
  [
    {:nimble_template, "~> 4.4.0", only: :dev, runtime: false},
    # other dependencies ...
  ]
end
```

Step 3: Fetch and install dependencies

Run this command in the root of the project directory to install NimbleTemplate.

```bash
mix do deps.get, deps.compile
```

## Usage

```bash
mix help nimble_template.gen # Print help

mix nimble_template.gen -v # Print the version

# Phoenix application
mix nimble_template.gen --web   # Apply the Web template
mix nimble_template.gen --api   # Apply the API template
mix nimble_template.gen --live  # Apply the LiveView template

# Non-Phoenix application
mix nimble_template.gen --mix # Apply the Mix template
```

## FAQ

### 1. Getting `(Mix) The task "phx.new" could not be found` error

The Phoenix application generator is missing. By solving this problem, you need to run

```bash
mix archive.install hex phx_new
```

or

```bash
mix archive.install hex phx_new #{specific-version}
```

### 2. Getting `Wallaby can't find chromedriver` error

Your OS is missing/not installing `chromedriver`, you need to run:

Homebrew

```bash
brew install --cask chromedriver
```

Debian/Ubuntu

```bash
apt install chromium-chromedriver
```

Or download the package on the official site: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
